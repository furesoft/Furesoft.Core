///     is automatically extended with attributes of added constraints
///     (see constrain()) and upon calls to  descend()
///     that request nodes that do not yet exist.
///     References to joined nodes in the query graph can be obtained
///     by "walking" along the nodes of the graph with the method
///     descend().
///     execute()
///     evaluates the entire graph against all persistent objects.
///     execute() can be called from any Query node
///     of the graph. It will return an ObjectSet filled with
///     objects of the class/classes that the node, it was called from,
///     represents.
